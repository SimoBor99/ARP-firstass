User Guide

Once you have followed the guide on README file, that is in the github repository, and it is mandatory before continue the reading of this guide, the first two things that you can see are graphical interfaces of konsole, which are described below. Do not worry if the two interface are bugged; sometimes it happens and, for fixing it, resize them with mouse, and everything will be fine.

In the first one there are six buttons:
*Vx will decrease of one unity the horizonthal velocity of the hoist end-effector;
*Vx- stop will set to zero the horizonthal velocity of the hoist end-effector;
*Vx+ will increase of a unity the horizonthal velocity of the hoist end-effector;
*Vz- will decrease of a unity the vertical velocity of the hoist end-effector;
*Vz stop will set to zero the vertical velocity of the hoist end-effector;
*Vz+ will increase of a unity the horizonthal velocity of the hoist end-effector.
You can press any button by the click of mouse; when you click, if you do not see any white phrase on the down left side, reclick on the button because sometimes your action is not registered.
If the end-effector arrives at a border (0-39 horizonthally and 0-9 vertically), it will stop there, but the velocity will not reset! So be careful to stop the horizonthal velocity before starting to go into the other direction.

In the second graphical interfece, we have a display of the hoist, where we can see the position of the hoist's end-effector. In this interface there are also two emergency buttons  that, when pressed, will immediately perform an emergency action:
* S will immediately stop the movement of the hoist's end-effector (both horizonthal and vertical);
* R will reset te position of the hoist's end-effector to the starting one (at (0;0)); the reset is not immediate, instead the end-effector will slowly start to go towards the origin.
If the S button is pressed while a reset is ongoing, the reset action will be cancelled and the end-effector will immediately stop.

To terminate the execution the are two different ways:
* The first one is to stop both motors and wait until a minute pass, without pressing any button; in this way, the master process will notice the minute of inactivity and will kill all processes and terminate its own execution;
* The second one is to press ctrl+C on the terminal window where the program has been launched: the master process kill all processes and terminate its own execution.
